\noindent\imp{Object:} Doctoral/Post-doctoral position\\ 
in satellite data processing/remote sensing 



\vspace{1cm}

Dear Mr. Clerbaux,

\vspace{1cm}


I recently found the the job offer on the IRM website and wanted to express my interest for the aforementioned position. 

Since the end of my studies in Engineering (University of Liège, 2005), I have contributed to several European projects and initiatives (most recently: \href{http://marine.copernicus.eu}{Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service}, \href{http://www.seadatanet.org}{SeaDataCloud}) related to environmental data, where my contributions encompass Research and Development aspects, user training as well as project proposal and user guide writing.

In relation to the job description, in almost all of my previous positions, I worked with remote sensed data related to the ocean (temperature, salinity, sea level anomaly, sea wind), for which I developed processing routines to improve, quality control, process and interpolate these satellite data, both in real-time and delayed-mode applications. These oceanographic datasets obviously share many similarities with atmospheric data, among them the netCDF format. 

You can find an up-to-date list of publications and presentations in the \textit{academic resume} (\url{https://ctroupin.github.io/CV/Ctroupin_CVacademic.pdf}). I would appreciate the opportunity to meet with you and discuss how my qualification fit your needs in this project and lead to solid and innovative outcomes.

Yours sincerely
