I am an engineer now working essentially on Data Analytics, with a strong background on numerical modelling and analysis. My previous experiences were all related to environmental data processing and were always taking place in international contexts.

During almost 3 years I also had the opportunity to lead a group of software engineers and IT specialists in an institute responsible for the aquisition of marine and oceanographic data. I strongly believe in the respect of my colleagues and of their work as a driver.

I am passionate about what I am doing and also curious to try innovative techniques to large datasets (often called Big Data even if it is not always the case), with leadership, integrity and focus.
