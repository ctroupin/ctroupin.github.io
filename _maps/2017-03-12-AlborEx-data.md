### Goal

The plan was to show all the [AlborEx mission](http://doi.socib.es/#/data-products/ALBOREX-2014-PERSEUS) data in a single, interactive map.      
Nothing fancy here, just playing with leaflet and converting the netCDF files into something that could easily be displayed.

### Results

{% include_relative maps/alborex.html %}

<br>

This could be a good alternative to the usual figures we have in almost each oceanographic paper showing the area of interest and the data locations: a dynamic map with different layers really allows reader to visualise the region of interest and see where the observations were made.
