An efficient design mixing the venue architecture (a lighthouse) and more technical elements (triangular mesh, contour lines), fruit of a discussion where we
explained our needs and provided the main ideas.

### Concept

Technical elements (finite-element mesh, iso-value contours, colored surfaces) were combined
with a textured version of the [*Revellata Lighthouse*](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sharlo1982/34845053842/) located close to the
workshop venue and used as the participant accommodation.

### Realization

The lighthouse was created from a real picture taken during a previous edition of the workshop.
The triangular element mesh was generated by the [`DIVA`](https://github.com/gher-ulg/DIVA) interpolation tool.
