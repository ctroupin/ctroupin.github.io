In order to illustrate the derivation of HF radar total velocities from the radials obtained at different sites, we prepared a step-by-step animation.

### Concept

It is always easier to explain complex systems by progressively increasing the quantity of information in the figure.

### Realization

Data are obtained from the [SOCIB](https://socib.eu). The green and yellow arrows are the radial velocities from *Galfi* (on Ibiza island) and Formentera sites, respectively. The while arrows are the total velocities derived from the radials.

The background image is taken from NASA [WorldView](http://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/), the dominant dark tone was chosen in order to fit with the presentation template.
