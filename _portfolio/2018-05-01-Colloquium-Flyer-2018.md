For the 50th Anniversary of the Colloquium, we needed a flyer that combined the new and the old, as the topic was *"Long Term Studies in Oceanography"*.

### Concept

The background image displays the ceiling of the Academic Room of the University of Liège, where the conference takes places for several years now.

The main image is an overlay of a map and a time series based on the participation during the last 49 years.

The font for the subtitle, *Aachen Bold*, is representative of the 1960's and is related to the origin of the colloquium back in 1969.


### Realization

The starting point was the `LaTeX` file from the 2016 flyer: the images were modified and the structure simplified.
