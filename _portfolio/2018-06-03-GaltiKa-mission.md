The *G-AltiKa* mission took place in August 2013. G is for glider, Altika is for the Altika altimeter. The plan was to follow the satellite track with a glider during a few hours, inside the area covered by the high-frequency radar, and compare the velocities obtained by all these platforms.

The illustration aimed to summarize the available dataset and the region of interest (the Ibiza Channel), without too much noise.
