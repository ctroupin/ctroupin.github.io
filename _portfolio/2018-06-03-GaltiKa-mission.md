The *G-AltiKa* mission took place in August 2013. *G* is for glider, *AltiKa* is for the Altika altimeter. The plan was to follow the satellite track with a glider during a few hours, inside the area covered by the high-frequency radar, and compare the velocities obtained by all these platforms.

The illustration aimed to summarize the available dataset and the region of interest (the Ibiza Channel), without too much noise:
* the background in blue tones is the bathymetry,
* the high-frequency radar coverage is shown by small dots and
* the glider and the satellite track are represented by thick lines.      

The only difference with other figures is the coastline: here we wanted to have a very high-resolution in order so we could see the small islands, in particular *Es Vedr√†*, west of Ibiza, just underneath the altimeter track.
