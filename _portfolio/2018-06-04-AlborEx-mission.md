In May 2014, the *AlborEx* took place with the objective to measure the water properties in a dynamic area of the Mediterranean Sea with a high spatial resolution. The sampling strategy included gliders, drifters, profiling floats...

The illustration had 2 purposes:
1. Display the available platforms deployed in the studied area.
2. Provide an overview of the condition (temperature and currents) when the mission took place.

The difficulty came from the quantity of information to be displayed. It took approximatively 20 iterations to reach the final version, even if, now that I'm looking at it again, there might be other improvements I should do.
