## Context

This one comes from a colleague's request when we were preparing the revision of a paper. We has to provide a figure showing the different regions of the Mediterranean Sea for a reviewer that did not know anything about it. Obviously I checked if there was already something we could adapt from another paper we did not find anything we really liked.

What I like is the exchanges that lead to final version of the product. I always start with something easy, even incomplete, that I can provide in less than one hour, then my colleague can iterate on it and we finally have something that both agree one.

## First versions

### Keeping it easy

Nothing fancy for this one: a fine-resolution coastline, the list of places arranged in 3 columns below the figure and a few labels for the meridians and the parallels.

### Refinement
Two minor changes: we though it would be better to have the names sorted by alphabetical order and to have the circle background in a lighter tone of grey. The circle positions were also slightly moves. Details, of course, but at the end what we do is a combination of details.

### Colors and more information
We decided to also add the bathymetry/topography, for it is a relevant information also mentioned in the paper. Two tries:
1. covering the whole domain (i.e., land and sea).
2. only on the sea.     

The country boundaries are also visible, though this is not always necessary. I have clearly a preference for one of them... Note that I don't show here the region labels, as they won't change anymore.

## Final version

I called it *final* because that's the last one I've prepared, but not the one we selected for the paper. Here to highlight the bathymetry we have 2 different colormaps, one for the land (grey tones) and one for the ocean (blue-yellow). The result is clean, as we wanted, the grey colors for the relief don't take too much the addition, while still adding some information.
