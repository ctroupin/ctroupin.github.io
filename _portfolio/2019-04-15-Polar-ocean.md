Every year we help to organise the colloquium with a involvement varying with the years, unfortunately in 2019 my contribution was limited to advertisements on social media and the conference flyer.

### Conception

One of the advantage of the topic, *Polar Ocean facing changes*, is that it can be connected to nice images and landscapes (it could not be possible for example with *Data assimilation*...). Thus we wanted to have several photographies used in the flyer. The title banner displays different aspect of the polar research: instrumentation, air-sea interaction, animals and of course humans.

Two fonts were used for the title:
1. a simple font providing an image of stability
2. another font with a more dramatic effect aimed to represent the changes.

The rest of the layout was kept similar to the previous years (here for [2016](../2016-05-01-Colloquium-Flyer) and [2018](../2018-05-01-Colloquium-Flyer-2018)). While it is not really innovative, the general style is consistent from one year to the next.

### Code

The LaTeX source is available on GitHub: [CLQ2019_poster.tex](https://github.com/gher-ulg/Liege-Colloquium-on-Ocean-Dynamics/blob/master/latex/CLQ2019_poster.tex). I must say that what you can do with the package `tcolorbox` is just amazing (the manual is 469-page long!).
