I could have written a "*About me*" stuff to start with the blog. I preferred to start something on anything.

### First step: a random idea.
It was quite easy to find this cool page, https://randomword.com/, and get an idea to work on. I must admit I had to refresh the page 2 times before finding a work that inspires me, at least slightly.     
The word: whithersoever.     
The meaning: to whatsoever place, according to [wordreference](http://www.wordreference.com/definition/whithersoever).

### Second step: the story.

During the last years I've been lucky enough to travel to many places. I cannot say I've traveled the world, but overall it's not too bad. Sometimes I just wonder: is there something common in all these countries? Something quite universal, that anybody can find without having to live somewhere for a long time.

Fortunately what I found until now is that people like to welcome other people. It's not a matter of language, not a matter of money, just a way to show that they're pleased to have you in their country. There are some exceptions of course, but I cannot really say where.

In 2010 we were in Nicosia for a meeting that started in the afternoon, hence in the morning we went to visit the old town, without really knowing what to see. In a random street, there was a couple of older persons that saw that we were taking pictures. They called us and invited us to enter their house. The house was very small, maybe two rooms, we were sitting in the living room, which was also the kitchen and the bedroom. They did not speak French, neither English, we didn't speed Greek, but whatever. We could communicate and see a little bit more of how people live there.

### Third: a picture

We did not take a single picture inside their house.

The time available to visit was way too short, partly due to another meeting in the U.S. just after. The feeling after the short trip was the same withersoever we go: cool place, nice people, and alsmost always great food.
