It's always cool to work on data very close to us, in this case I mean the running tracks around the office. The simple and direct visualisation consists in plotting all the trails on the map and add a *heatmap* or *hexbin* layer to see the spatial density.      
Here I try to explore other possibilities.

## Read the data
First thing first: get the data. GPX is a wide-spread format and [`gpxpy`](https://github.com/tkrajina/gpxpy) the perfect tool to read the files. In the past I had my own parsing function using *regex* but hey, why not using what already exists?

### Available data
I have tracks since 2013, though most of the tracks around Sart Tilman are concentrated
in 2017-2018. The total is about 150 files.

### Processing
We will compute:
* the distance to a central point, located close to our offices, using the `Vincenty` distance function available in th [`geopy`](https://github.com/geopy/geopy) module,
* the direction with (e.g. northward, southward, eastward, ...) with respect to the starting point, using the `bearing` function from the [`geo-py`](https://github.com/gojuno/geo-py) module
* the altitude, directly read from the file.

The loop takes 15-20 seconds.

## Figures

### Direction histogram
We start with an histogram to display the most frequent zone with respect to the starting point.

We directly see that we spend more time in the southeast sector, which makes sense knowing that the sport facilities and the track are located there.

I did not compute anything here but it's clear from the plot that we stay almost always within 4 km from our starting point. In fact the locations at more than 8 km from *Sart Tilman* come from a race done in *Esneux* and training sessions in Li√®ge center, which I might remove from the database.

### Positions in polar coordinates
In this figure we simply plot the different tracks in the new coordinate system with some points of interest (red dots) that we use to visit, helping me to check if everything is correct.

```python
pointsInterest = [
    [50.552, 5.5502, "Roche aux Faucons"],
    [50.6024, 5.5957, "Lande de Streupas"],
    [50.5818, 5.6027, "Rochers du bout du monde"],
    [50.6007, 5.5554, "Point de vue"],
    ];
```

### Positions and altitude

Same as the previous one, but now the dots are colored according to the altitude measured by the device.
The lowest parts (dark blue) are the valleys of the *Meuse* and the *Ourthe* rivers.

## Final results: the pseudo-color plot

Final one: the goal is to count count how many times we've been in different subregions delimited by angles and distances. I won't write the whole code here, just the lines that allows us to count quite easily.

```python
r_edges = np.arange(0, 6.01, 0.5)
theta_edges = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, ntheta + 1) + np.pi/16.
H, _, _ = np.histogram2d(distances, angles, [r_edges, theta_edges])
```

I think it's a nice starting point for other fancier versions. I like to see that some we're often running in the same areas, for example the western sector (north of *Boncelles*) is almost void.
