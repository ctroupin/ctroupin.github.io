Typical situation: you have to use a *powerpoint* template for a presentation, but you are more kind of a LaTeX person, so what to do?

1. When the template is not very well designed: just *forget* to use it and hope that nobody will notice during the meeting.
2. When it is good or when you have a lot of pressure to comply: you might be tempted to do an effort and use it (the template, not powerpoint).

I'll try to explain how to do that, hopefully speeding up the process to go from a ppt template to a LaTeX beamer template.

**Disclaimer:** I know that an easier solution would be "*just swicth to powerpoint (or equivalent)*". There are many reasons one may have to stick to LaTeX, for example if using already existing texts, figures or equations from other documents.

## 1. Prepare the background

Often the background is rather complex (logos, color gradients, shapes), so reproducing it in pure LaTeX ([`TikZ`](https://ctan.org/pkg/pgf?lang=en) etc), while feasible, is not an option.

Also let's not forget that the template has a distinct background for the title slide and for the other slides.

### 1.1 Convert the template to PDF

Start with an empty presentation (let's call it `mytemplate.ppt`), and then export to PDF file (`mytemplate.pdf`).     
You could obviously use a bitmap format (jpg, png, ...) instead of a PDF. Try and see what give the best result.

In the options, use *Lossless compression* (instead of jpeg compression) and select a good resolution (>= 300 dpi) for the reduction of the image resolution.

### 1.2 Extract the title background and the slide background

From the file `mytemplate.pdf`, we need to extract the 1st and the 2nd slides.     
This is easily done, for example using the tool [`pdftk`](https://www.pdflabs.com/docs/pdftk-cli-examples/).

```bash
pdftk mytemplate.pdf cat 1 output background1.pdf
pdftk mytemplate.pdf cat 2 output background2.pdf
```

**Alternative:** a simple screenshot tool can also be a solution to obtain the backgrounds.

### 1.3 Include the background in the beamer template.

For all the slides (except the title slide), you just have to add the command:
```latex
\usebackgroundtemplate{\includegraphics[width=\paperwidth]{background2.pdf}}
```
before or after the \begin{document}.

For the title slide (we will see later how to format it), we need to have curly brackets
around the frame, like this:
```latex
{
\usebackgroundtemplate{\includegraphics[width=\paperwidth]{background1.pdf}}
\begin{frame}
...
\end{frame}
}
```
The `{ }` around the *frame* environment means that the `\usebackgroundtemplate{ }`
is only applied for the current slide.

Combining this, a MWE would look like:

```latex
\documentclass{beamer}
\usepackage{graphicx}

\begin{document}

{
\usebackgroundtemplate{\includegraphics[width=\paperwidth]{background1.pdf}}
\begin{frame}
...
\end{frame}
}

\usebackgroundtemplate{\includegraphics[width=\paperwidth]{background2.pdf}}

\begin{frame}
...
\end{frame}

\end{document}
```
If you compile this file with `pdflatex` or `xelatex`, you should obtain something
that looks pretty close to the original template.

## 2. Setting text properties

### 2.1 Colors

Different text elements (title, authors, slide titles, ...) may have different colors.
When it's only black and white, it is straightforward. If not, you should use a *color picker*,
for instance I use [`gcolor2`](http://gcolor2.sourceforge.net/).

Let's imagine that the authors have the color `#7F7F7F` (HTML notation) and the slide titles have
`#0D6CAC`.             
So you define new colors in the preamble of the LaTeX document:
```latex
\definecolor{color1}{HTML}{7F7F7F}
\definecolor{color2}{HTML}{0D6CAC}
```
Then you have to specify the color of all the presentation elements:
```latex
\setbeamercolor{title}{fg=white}
\setbeamercolor{author}{fg=color1}
\setbeamercolor{institute}{fg=color1}
\setbeamercolor{frametitle}{fg=color2}
\setbeamercolor{date}{fg=color1}
```
The `fg` means foreground, as it is also possible the background using the `bg` option.

### 2.2 Font type

LaTeX default font (*Computer Modern*) is not always the best choice and is often the first thing that makes someone think
"*this has been prepared with LaTex*". We first have to identify the font(s) used in the ppt.

| Element       | Font name     | Weight  | Size |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -------:| ----:|
| Author        | Open Sans     | Regular | 18   |
| Title         | Arial         | Bold    | 28   |
| Subtitle      | Open Sans     | Regular | 15   |
| Text          | Arial         | Regular | 28   |
| Frame title   | Arial         | Bold    | 30   |

We have to use two new fonts: `Arial` and `Open Sans`. XeLaTeX allows you to use True Type (TTF) and Open Type fonts (OTF).
Anytime you have to play with fonts, a good resource is the [LaTeX font catalog](https://tug.org/FontCatalogue/): there
you can find a long list of fonts and the commands to use them in your document.

* `Arial` is unfortunately a commercial font and we need to find an equivalent, which means it is maybe not available on your machine. If it is, you can simply use:
```latex
\usepackage{fontspec}
\setmainfont{Arial}
```
* `Open Sans` has an entry in the font catalog: https://tug.org/FontCatalogue/opensans/.

### 2.3 Font size

#### Slide elements

Each element of a presentation can be assigned a different size, for example with the title:
```latex
\setbeamerfont{title}{size=\huge}
```
Here we know the font size in pts (see Section 2.2), hence it is easier to directly specify these numbers in the command:
```latex
\setbeamerfont{title}{size=\fontsize{28pt}{10}\selectfont}
```
The second argument of `\fontsize{}{}` is the `baselineskip` value.      
However this just does not work: in Beamer, using 28pt for the title is way too big, and bigger than
what we had the original ppt.

**Solution?**
* Try different values, until we have something similar to the title in ppt,
* then for the other elements we just conserve the ratios.

Here we end up with
```latex
\setbeamerfont{title}{size=\fontsize{14pt}{10}\selectfont}
\setbeamerfont{author}{size=\fontsize{9pt}{10}\selectfont}
\setbeamerfont{subtitle}{size=\fontsize{7.5pt}{10}\selectfont}
\setbeamerfont{frametitle}{size=\fontsize{15pt}{10}\selectfont}
\setbeamerfont{date}{size=\fontsize{9pt}{10}\selectfont}
```
i.e., we have divided the original font size by 2.

#### Slide text

Now to set the size of the main text (i.e., the slide content), it can be done with the first line of the
document:
```latex
\documentclass[14pt]{beamer}
```
**Note:** the value `20pt` seems the largest you can set: if you try with, for instance `28pt`, the text will end up
in the default value (`11pt`). Here we set it again to half the value obtained from the ppt.

### 2.4 Font weight

Decide if the text has to be normal, bold etc. According to the template, both the title and the frame titles should be in bold. We could do that using the `series=\bfseries` option:
```latex
\setbeamerfont{title}{size=\fontsize{14pt}{10}\selectfont,series=\bfseries}
\setbeamerfont{frametitle}{size=\fontsize{15pt}{10}\selectfont,series=\bfseries}
```
However, again comparing with the ppt template, we see that the results are better without that option.

## 3. Slide layout

Most of the issues concerning the text has been solved, but still, the result does not look like the original ppt,
mainly because the different elements are not well placed in the slides. Let's fix that.

### 3.1 Frame title

By default it appears in the top-left corner. It may require some adaptations according to the template.
One way to that is to add vertical and horizontal spaces before the frame title:
```latex
\setbeamertemplate{frametitle}{\vspace*{1cm}\hspace*{1.75cm}\insertframetitle}
```
The values set here were found by successive tries. Again, it is not a question of millimeters, nobody will notice
the difference if your frame title has an horizontal offset.

### 3.2 Title slide

We kept this part for the end as it can be tedious: all the elements (title, subtitle, date, ...) have to
be properly placed and defined
```latex
\defbeamertemplate*{title page}{customized}[1][]
{

}
```
We will use the commands `\inserttitle`, `\insertdate`, `\insertauthor`, etc for each element.  
There is also a possibility to include graphics (logo etc). The final command looks like:
```latex
\defbeamertemplate*{title page}{customized}[1][]
{

	\vspace{3cm}

  {\usebeamerfont{title}\usebeamercolor[fg]{title}\inserttitle}

  \vspace{.8cm}

  {\usebeamerfont{subtitle}\usebeamercolor[fg]{subtitle}\insertsubtitle, } \usebeamerfont{date}\usebeamercolor[fg]{date}\insertdate

  \vspace{1.cm}

  \hspace*{5.25cm}
  \begin{minipage}[c]{2.5cm}
  \flushright
	{\usebeamerfont{author}\usebeamercolor[fg]{author}\insertauthor}
  \end{minipage}\hspace{.15cm}
  \begin{minipage}[c]{1cm}
  \flushright
	\inserttitlegraphic
  \end{minipage}

  \vfill
}
```
but it required (too) many tests to figure out the right positions. Another solution is to use `TikZ` and specify
the exact positions of each element with respect to a grid.
