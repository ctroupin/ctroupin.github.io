## The project

The *G-AltiKa* mission took place in August 2013. *G* is for glider, *AltiKa* is for the [AltiKa](https://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/missions/current-missions/saral/instruments-1/altika-a-ka-band-altimeter.html) altimeter. The objective was to follow the satellite track with a glider during a few hours, inside the area covered by the high-frequency radar, and compare the velocities obtained by all these platforms. That is probably the first time such a comparison was done, thanks to the [SOCIB](www.socib.es) multi-platform capability.

## Contributions

- Processing of the observations from the different sensors
- Comparison of the velocity fields obtained by each platform

## Results

- AltiKa measurements allow one to get velocity measurement closer to the coastline, in comparison with other altimeters.       
- Multi-platform study, where the information from gliders, drifters, altimeters... are combined together, have a great potential for studying the small-scale dynamics in the Mediterranean Sea.
