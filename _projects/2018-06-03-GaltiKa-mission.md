The *G-AltiKa* mission took place in August 2013. *G* is for glider, *AltiKa* is for the AltiKa altimeter. The objective was to follow the satellite track with a glider during a few hours, inside the area covered by the high-frequency radar, and compare the velocities obtained by all these platforms. That is probably the first time such a comparison was done, thanks to the [SOCIB](www.socib.es) multi-platform capability.

This illustration aimed to summarize the available dataset and the region of interest (the Ibiza Channel), without too much noise:
* the background in blue tones is the bathymetry,
* the high-frequency radar coverage is shown by small dots and
* the glider and the satellite track are represented by thick lines.      

The only difference with other figures is the coastline: here we wanted to have a very high-resolution in order so we could see the small islands, in particular *Es Vedr√†*, west of Ibiza, just underneath the altimeter track.
