When you look at the map, you realize the city is not so extended, the center has probably a diameter of 2.5 km.

### <i class="fas fa-shoe-prints"></i> Classic
Some locals told us to run following the city walls, kind of an hexagonal shape (the orange line). There is a bike lane most of the time, but also lot of traffic lights, noise and ... bikes. I did not try it, surely for a pure, flat session it’s ok.

### <i class="fas fa-map-signs"></i> _Hors des sentiers battus_
I experienced several tracks in the southern part of Bologna: first you have to cross the city (if you’re located close to the train station -- red circle), and there are a few, almost straight streets that you can follow to get out of it. Once you’re out of the hexagon, you have many choices, it becomes hilly and the funny part can start.

### <i class="fas fa-star"></i> A few tracks I liked

[Osservanza – Villa Ghigi](https://www.wikiloc.com/running-trails/bologna-osservanza-parco-villa-ghigi-46043792): the hilly landscape is very nice, hard to think we’re a few kilometers from the center. There is also a 135-km hiking path called the [*Via degli Dei*](http://www.viadeglidei.it/?lang=en) (Path of Gods) that you can follow (part of it) if you have time. It goes from Bologna to Florence.     
[San Luca](https://www.wikiloc.com/running-trails/bologna-san-luca-46043990): the road is rather steep and view at the top is amazing. Many tourists and locals going there during the weekend, no many cars on the road if you prefer to avoid the stairs.
