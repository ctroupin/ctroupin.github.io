				<p>In this post, we are going to talk about how the temperature of sea water is measured!   <br />
<strong>Answer:</strong> with a thermometer? Yes, right, the thread is over… or maybe not, there is a little more to tell!</p>

<p><img src="https://ctroupin.github.io/figures/blog/sea-water-temperature/temperature002.JPG" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>At the end of the 19th century, during the <em>Challenger expedition</em> (1873-1876), the temperature was measured with a special thermometer, as it tried to minimize the effects of the high pressure found under water (yes, water is heavy).</p>

<p>Let’s see how that has changed over the centuries. In the followings:   <br />
✔️ = advantages     <br />
❌ = inconsistencies</p>

<h3 id="the-ship">The ship</h3>

<p>It continues to be a fundamental element for observing the ocean.    <br />
❌: cost (crew, scientists, food, diesel) and sometimes difficult with bad sea conditions.     <br />
✔️: analysis of the water sample inside the boat (there are usually laboratories), and you can go where you need to.</p>

<p><img src="https://ctroupin.github.io/figures/blog/sea-water-temperature/barco.jpg" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>On the ship, what is called a CTD (conductivity, temperature, depth) is used a lot. In general, the CTD is accompanied by a rosette, where there are bottles that allow collecting water samples at various depths.</p>

<p><img src="https://ctroupin.github.io/figures/blog/sea-water-temperature/CTD.JPG" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>As sometimes it is not convenient to go out with the ship, the engineers and scientists invented a series of devices that do not need the direct presence of humans.</p>

<p><img src="https://ctroupin.github.io/figures/blog/sea-water-temperature/oldschool.png" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<h3 id="drifting-buoys">Drifting buoys</h3>

<p>The buoys follow surface currents, and sometimes have a temperature sensor.    <br />
✔️: low cost, measured along streamlines.   <br />
❌: does not give any information under the sea surface.</p>

<p><img src="https://ctroupin.github.io/figures/blog/sea-water-temperature/boyas.JPG" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<h3 id="mooring">Mooring</h3>

<p>It is an almost fixed structure, connected to the seabed by a cable. Instruments at various depths are placed on the cable.        <br />
✔️: allows one to obtain long time series, at various depths.        <br />
❌: maintenance: after several months in contact with the sea, the sensors are covered with stuff that prevent proper functioning.</p>

<p><img src="https://ctroupin.github.io/figures/blog/sea-water-temperature/mooring.png" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<h3 id="argo-profiler">Argo profiler</h3>

<p>Like the buoy, it drifts with the currents, but has the possibility of going down to several 1000’s of meters.          <br />
✔️: provides temperature profiles; other sensors can be added (oxygen, chlorophyll, pH, …)     <br />
❌: cost (although better than a ship), and the fact that it cannot be taken exactly where one needs it.</p>

<p>Follow @EuroArgoERIC and @ArgoSpain1 if want to know more about profilers.</p>

<h3 id="glider">Glider</h3>

<p>It is a type of submarine controlled by an operator. It does not have a motor, but its buoyancy can be changed thanks to a piston.      <br />
✔️ operates in any conditions, and provides data with very high resolution.      <br />
❌ again the cost, not only the purchase, but the maintenance (batteries etc).</p>

<p>Follow @ego_gliderman and @SeaExplorerUUV for real-team information about glider
missions.</p>

<p><img src="https://ctroupin.github.io/figures/blog/sea-water-temperature/glider1.png" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>I think the glider deserves its own thread, there is a lot to tell!
Follow @Med_clic and take a look at <a href="http://medclic.es/es/instrumentos/glider/">http://medclic.es/es/instrumentos/glider/</a>.</p>

<h3 id="others">Others</h3>

<p>Is it all? Of course not! Some ships, especially in the Baltic Sea, have a so-called <em>FerryBox</em> mounted: it is a fixed system, inside the ship, that receives water from the sea and measures its properties (temperatures and other parameters).        <br />
✔️ low cost, take advantage of the journey of a non-scientific ship.    <br />
❌ always the same routes, and only gives information at a depth of a few meters (~ 5 meters).</p>

<p><img src="https://ctroupin.github.io/figures/blog/sea-water-temperature/Australia_1834.JPG" class="img-responsive" />
(here the photo has nothing to do with FerryBox, since the ones I found are super crappy)</p>

<p>With all that, nothing is wrong, but there is more: the animals. No, it is not a mistake, there are animals in the sea to measure the temperature. They are generally seals, and you put a sensor on their head, then they drop it, and when it comes to the surface, the data is transmitted by satellite.</p>

<p>✔️ access to an area where you would not go with a boat, high depths, exploration of the polar areas.      <br />
❌ you have to capture the animals. However, protocols and ethical requirements are followed.</p>

<h2 id="the-end">The end</h2>
<p>I closed the thread. I’m sure I forget a lot of things, I think the general idea is. In short: a lot of devices in the ocean, each of them with advantages and disadvantages, and little by little reducing costs and then improving coverage.</p>
