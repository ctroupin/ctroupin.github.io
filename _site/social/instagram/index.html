				<p>Sorry guys, if you were looking for my Instagram profiles… it’s not here!
But as you’ve come here, let me tell you a story.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>It started in 2014 or 2015 in Mallorca, where I was working. One of my passion is landscape photography, and Mallorca mountains and beaches are the perfect scenes for that. At that time I had a smart-phone and I thought that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Instagram</code> could be a nice platform to</p>
<ol>
  <li>Discover new places thanks to other members.</li>
  <li>Share nice shots of places I see when I go hiking or trail running.</li>
</ol>

<p>This last point turned out to be one of the reason I deleted my account, but I’ll explain that
later in this post.</p>

<p>For me the key in that social media was:</p>

<p>Insta = instant: basically you’re supposed to publish something occurring <em>here</em> and
<em>now</em>, for instance: you’re at a basketball game and make a picture of the final, winning shoot.
Or close to a thunderstorm and shoot some lightning (true, with a smart-phone it’s not easy).</p>

<p>OK, that was my own view, and maybe not it’s quite far from its current use.</p>

<h2 id="what-happened">What happened?</h2>

<p>Nothing fancy: when I started sharing stuff on Instagram, I was also following people living in the same area, I was followed back by some of them, but also by strange profiles that I would discard.</p>

<p>At that time I was working at <em>Parc Bit</em> and they organized a competition for the best picture on Instagram, related to Parc Bit of course. There were really nice photos, I remember one taken by drone (ok, not taken with a smart-phone I guess) that was a piece of art.</p>

<p>A few weeks later they decided which picture won: I remember that picture was just OK, but had thousand of <em>likes</em>, while the rest had hundreds. As I’m a data scientist, I checked a little bit further and browse through the people that <em>liked</em> the winning picture. Strangely, a large proportion of those accounts had almost no activity on <em>Insta’</em>: no followers, no pictures published, nothing. Just likes to other accounts, more specifically <em>likes</em> to that picture.</p>

<h2 id="so-why-did-i-close-the-account">So why did I close the account?</h2>

<p>Of course, people cheating is not a valid reason to delete an account</p>
