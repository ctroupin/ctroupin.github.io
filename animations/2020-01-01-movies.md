## Animations/movies

I still need to find a way to publish the animations in this blog. But basically, the idea is not very complex:
we generate a sequence of images with some kind of motion: drifters, currents or change of the view point.
Then from that sequence it is quite direct to generate a movie using tools such as [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/).
