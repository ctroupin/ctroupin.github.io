### High-quality figures


#### Drifter trajectories

The authors needed an illustration showing the drifter trajectories and the main oceanic structures as an overlay.

In addition to the trajectories, we also represented the sea water temperature using a scatter plot. The diverging colormap highlights the contrast between the cool Atlantic Water and the warmer Mediterranean Water.

The Western and Eastern Atlantic Gyres (WAG and EAG) are represented as circle in projected coordinates. The arrows are added as a small segment of the circle annotated with a specific arrow style.

The Atlantic Jet are designed in 2 steps:
1. with a click-and-save technique, the coordinates of a series of points are captured and stored in an intermediate file;
2. a spline function is applied on the coordinates to obtain a smooth line.

#### Sea-level anomaly field over the Global Ocean

The gridded field is obtained by applying the Data-Interpolation Variational Analysis ([Diva](link to diva)) technique to along-track altimetric data.

The background image is a [geoTiff](geotiff link) file obtained from the NASA [Earth View](earthview lin;-k) web. The field is represented using contour lines with color ranging from blue to red, with the zero displayed in white. The contour lines suited better to distinguish the areas with weaker eddies.

The AlborEx mission consisted of a multi-platform experiment performed in the Alboran Sea in May 2014. A figure showing all the platform deployments at a glance was required by the authors. An agile interaction was set up with them: a first version of the figure was quickly produced, then very short iterations was performed until the final version was obtained.

To provide more context to the image, a high-resolution sea surface temperature image was added as the background. In order to avoid simulating fake fronts, a colorbar with a uniform variation in intensity was chosen.

The geostrophic velocity field is displayed using streamlines. The grey intensity of the streamlines reflects the intensity of the geostrophic currents. 

The inset image gives a detailed view of the deployments along with a clear caption.
