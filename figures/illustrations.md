For over 10 years I have been creating figures for scientific publications 
and more recently I have designed conference flyers.

## Scientific illustration

Since the beginning of my career I have always paid attention to the details
of the graphical material we had to produce for peer-reviewed publications, posters or presentations.
Looking back at my first creations, I am glad to observe a continuous improvement and the development of
a capacity to properly convey a message through a figure or an animation.
