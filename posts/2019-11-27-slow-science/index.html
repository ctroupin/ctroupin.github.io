				<p>Recent chats with different scientists made me think about how the Sciences goes
these days. While I cannot consider myself as an experienced researcher, I still
have enough perspective to see the evolution of some parts of the system.   <br />
Something that really caught my attention is that many of us are happy with the
work we are doing, but at the same time we would not recommend our kids to do the
same. This is maybe serious. Let’s go back in time.</p>

<h2 id="2007">2007</h2>

<p>That was my first conference ever, and I had really no idea about what to expect from it. My boss at that time, Pablo, suggested I present the results from the Master Thesis, so OK, let’s do that. The place: <em>Valencia</em>, on the eastern side of Spain. The venue: <em>Ciudad de Artes Ciencias</em>, a beautiful set of buildings created by the a famous architect, also known for designing costly, yet unpractical train stations in Belgium.</p>

<p><img src="https://ctroupin.github.io/figures/blog/slow-science/Valencia07_075.jpg" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>Within the building there was kind of an exhibition, one of them was about scientists and famous sentences they had pronounced. I remember one particularly well (probably because of the pictures): Wolfgang Pauli, who said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don’t care you thinking slowly, I only care you publishing faster than you think.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://ctroupin.github.io/figures/blog/slow-science/Valencia07_082.jpg" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>At that time it looked like a nice scientific joke, today it seems to be an accurate way to describe a situation.</p>

<p>During the conference there are exactly three talks I can remember:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The guy that presented just before me: he took probably 15 minutes more than the allowed time (12 minutes), so I was asked to speed up my presentation (to compensate). Nice way to start with the world of scientific conferences.</li>
  <li>A <em>very high h-index</em> guy: he presented also something nice, along the lines of “we’ve done this, we’ve done that”, and obviously he had published dozens of times every year. I also remember that my friend Iñaki told me: “<em>Charles, this guy cannot publish so many papers each year; it’s because he has many postdocs and students doing all the work for him</em>”. Yes, but the guy was really good at talking, so…</li>
  <li>Finally, a great talk by a famous physical oceanographer: I can’t remember the name of the talk, but as far as I can remember it was a mix between science and philosophy, trying to explain to the younger scientists, us, that you have to spend more time looking at the data, trying to understand processes, than directly writing a paper, looking for another funding that will allow you to get more data, that you won’t have time to look at because of the time.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://ctroupin.github.io/figures/blog/Valencia07_035.jpg" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>I think he was talking about #SlowScience, before the term was coined.</p>

<h2 id="2020s">2020’s</h2>

<p>What’s fun when I look at that conference several years later, is that it tells you what you need to know right from the beginning:</p>
<ol>
  <li>there are scientists (many) that work with passion on what they like and can transmit that to everybody.</li>
  <li>there are the <em>publication-machines</em>, they can also be part of the previous type of scientists, for whom the <em>h-index</em> is the most essential variable.</li>
  <li>at some point, you will run out of time.</li>
</ol>

<p>This makes me think about a dinner we had at my boss’s house, I’d say it was around 2008-2009, and he said something like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>enjoy doing real science while you can”,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which at that time, we did not understand (at least, I did not understand totally). Now, the thing is: the later you understand, the better.</p>

<p>The situation described by the famous oceanographer during his talk is basically the situation we are living in now: no time to look into the data; writing project proposal one after another; meeting after meeting after meeting… I don’t think what we are doing now is correct, especially for the next generation of scientists.</p>

<h2 id="in-the-next-episode">In the next episode…</h2>

<p>This is the end for this first post.
In the <a href="../2021-03-09-slow-science2">next one</a>, we will talk about:</p>
<ul>
  <li>projects,</li>
  <li>conferences and of course…</li>
  <li>publications!</li>
</ul>
