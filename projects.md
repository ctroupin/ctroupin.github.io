### Projects

#### Geospatial data analysis

Most of the things I've worked on recently (out of the office) are related to
spatial information and the results ended up on various Leatlet maps.

* [General map for the AlborEx mission](leaflet/alborex.md)
* [Map for the Grand Jogging de Verviers](./leaflet/joggingVerviers.md)
* [Choropleth for the Airbnb properties in Mallorca](./leaflet/MallorcaAirbnb.md)
* [Diva interpolation: inputs and outputs](./leaflet/DivaBlackSea.md)

#### Hiking in Gran Canaria

After several years of hiking and running in the island, I though it was time
to write a book about it. The plan is to describe typical tracks, but also to
help readers design their own routes by providing all the sources of
useful information.
