No, this is not an error, this is my *facebook* page.     
I opened an account many years ago and finally closed it in 2015.

### Why?

There are many good reasons but in summary:
1. I was really getting bored.
2. Their boss is not somebody I appreciate.
3. Even if I did not spend too much time with it, any minute is a lost minute.

### Missing it?

No way! Of course they are a few persons that you have to contact before deleting
the account, to get another way to get in touch. Other wise fine.

Then the more I read about their boss, the more I'm happy I left.
