Started around 2015, deleted almost the same year.

### Why?

1. I was getting tired with these long list of hash-tags after each photo. I was not about describing a photo, but rather about tagging even using words without any relationship.
3. Same as for `Facebook`: their boss...

### Missing it?

Could be good to share pictures, now Twitter is not too bad for that these days.
