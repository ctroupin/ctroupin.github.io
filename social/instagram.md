Sorry guys, if you were looking for my Instagram profiles... it's not here!
But as you've come here, let me tell you a story.

## Getting started
It started in 2014 or 2015 in Mallorca, where I was working. One of my passion is landscape photography, and Mallorca mountains and beaches are the perfect scenes for that. At that time I had a smart-phone and I thought that `Instagram` could be a nice platform to
1. Discover new places thanks to other members.
2. Share nice shots of places I see when I go hiking or trail running.

This last point turned out to be one of the reason I deleted my account, but I'll explain that
later in this post.

For me the key in that social media was:

Insta = instant: basically you're supposed to publish something occurring *here* and
*now*, for instance: you're at a basketball game and make a picture of the final, winning shoot.
Or close to a thunderstorm and shoot some lightning (true, with a smart-phone it's not easy).

OK, that was my own view, and maybe not it's quite far from its current use.

## What happened?

Nothing fancy: when I started sharing stuff on Instagram, I was also following people living in the same area, I was followed back by some of them, but also by strange profiles that I would discard.

At that time I was working at *Parc Bit* and they organized a competition for the best picture on Instagram, related to Parc Bit of course. There were really nice photos, I remember one taken by drone (ok, not taken with a smart-phone I guess) that was a piece of art.

A few weeks later they decided which picture won: I remember that picture was just OK, but had thousand of *likes*, while the rest had hundreds. As I'm a data scientist, I checked a little bit further and browse through the people that *liked* the winning picture. Strangely, a large proportion of those accounts had almost no activity on *Insta'*: no followers, no pictures published, nothing. Just likes to other accounts, more specifically *likes* to that picture.

## So why did I close the account?

Of course, people cheating is not a valid reason to delete an account
