The social I most recently deleted... I don't remember when it started, but during a short span of time I tried to use it seriously and get a bunch of new contacts, which worked well for a few weeks. Then nothing interesting came out in.

## Why?

1. Never got any interesting job offer or anything relevant in many years. A some point I was getting lot of calls from recruiters but they were not very professional.
2. The design and the responsiveness of the web make me think we are in 2005, not 2020.
3. Microsoft stuff
