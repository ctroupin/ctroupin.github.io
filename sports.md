## Trail running

I started trail-running in Gran Canaria. It comes naturally: after I explored part of the island walking, one day I though: ok, let's do the same running. 
The direct benefit is that you can see much more in the same amount of time, at the cost of being a little bit more tired.

Now I try to run everywhere I go, either for work or on holiday. Not only can I discover new places and tracks, but also I made several friends that share the same passion for the sport. Here is where we've been running recently around the [Sart Tilman](./leaflet/Running-SartTilman.html) (Liège).

Prior to that, I've been organizing trekking and running activities in [Mallorca](./leaflet/MallorcaActivities.html) with my colleagues, especially in the *Tramuntana*. 

## Past races

### 2017

**[La Redoutable](https://sites.google.com/site/rtsprimont4140/la-redoutable)**, Sprimont, 29 km (we did 2 more). Running in Wallonie is always a pleasure. This one was very cool as we had to climb the famous *Redoute*. With some other 15 runners we got lost by the 23rd km and had to look for our way for 10 minutes, at least we could reach the finish line. 

**[TransGranCanaria](https://ctroupin.wordpress.com/2017/02/27/crossing-gran-canaria/)**, Gran Canaria, 125 km. The longest race I did. The motivation dates back to 2007 or 2008, when I saw finishers along *Las Canteras* beach in Las Palmas. 
I skipped it for many years because of the registration cost, finally I did it because of my attachment to the island. 

### 2016

**[Mallorca K42](https://www.wikiloc.com/wikiloc/view.do?id=12641760)**, Mallorca, 44 km. Probably the least pleasant race I had. The first 20 km or so were cool, in the mountains, then back at the starting point we had to follow a stream, then back on the road almost until the finish line. 

**Take 5 in the Garden of the Gods**, Colorado Springs (Colorado), 5 miles. As I was in Colorado for a meeting, I tried to find a nice race during the weekend. The only possibility turns out to be that one! A short but amazing race in the so-called *Garden of the Gods*. The altitude around 2000 m makes it somewhat difficult. [Results](http://www.ccrtiming.com/events-results/2016-results/take-5.htm): 9th overall, and also the only runner not from Colorado!

### 2015

**[TransVulcania](https://ctroupin.wordpress.com/2015/05/13/de-fuencaliente-a-los-llanos-de-aridane-transvulcania-2015/)**, La Palma: 3rd participation to that race, and the edition for which I had the best preparation. A lot of good sensations, until the top of the island, the *Roque de los Muchachos*. The rest was painful but what matters is to finish. I really really have to do it again, I need a revenge.

**[Tomir 42](https://ctroupin.wordpress.com/2015/03/29/running-in-pollenca-the-tomir42-race/)**, Pollença, Mallorca: I knew about the race beforehand and really felt I had to give it a try. The distance is reasonable but the elevation (> 2000 m) and the technical parts make it a tough race. *Tomir* is one of the hills above 1000 m in Mallorca.

**Maratón de les muntanyes d’Artà**: I enjoyed the edition the year before, hence participating again was almost mandatory. Good feelings during the 4 hours 37 minutes of race. I thought it was my best time for a marathon (I never tried a flat one), unfortunately we were slightly below the 42 km. Probably the race I would recommend to trail runners visiting the island.

### 2014

**[Utra Tramuntana](https://ctroupin.wordpress.com/2014/04/21/crossed-mallorca/)**, Mallorca, 112 km: crossing an island from side to side is always something fun and symbolic: it's you against the hills (or against the gravity). I missed the registration for the 2013 edition and had time to be well prepared for that one. The plan was to cross the finish line in about 18 hours. It took me one hour more. After the race I was sure I didn't want to repeat, not for the difficulty, but rather for the route (boring roads) and for the race atmosphere.

**[Maratón de les muntanyes d’Artà](https://ctroupin.wordpress.com/2014/11/05/maraton-de-muntanyes-darta/)**, Artà, Mallorca: nice distance inside of quite remote place in the island: the *Parc natural de la Península de Llevant*. The race I enjoyed the most during the time I spent on the island. 

### 2013

**TransVulcania** (2nd time): a good training program while living in Mallorca helped me improve my time and condition. Still hard to properly run the long descent from Roque de los Muchachos to Tazacorte. The greatest public, once again! 

### 2012

**Trail des Crêtes de Spa**: I had a mixed success in my participations to the classical 21 km in Spa and I decided to try the 1st edition of that trail. Lot of fun, good legs, cool atmosphere. The visibility was so bad that the day after I went to take pictures of some places we've been passing by. 

### 2011

**Grand Trail des Lacs et Chateaux**: why not a race a few kilometers from home? 18 km on Saturday and then 45 on Sunday, a nice experience to re-discover my own region. I'm not sure why I didn't try longer distances that year. 

### 2010

**TransVulcania** (1st time) , La Palma, 73 km: often considered as the hardest race in the islands, the *Transvulcania* is now famous around the world, thanks to the beauty of the landscapes, to the famous participants and to its exceptional public. In 2010 for the 2nd edition we were very few to challenge the insane elevation profile of La Palma. The training was better than for the Challenger, but still very basic. The day after the race I said that it was the toughest thing I did in my life.

### 2009

**Gran Canaria Challenger**, Gran Canaria: it's funny to think that my first trail ever was a race of 75 km. I'm not sure how I did to finish with this zero experience. The first part until the top of the island went not too bad, then going down to sea level was painful in the end. We did it!
